# Luganda Math Library
This is a Luganda Math library that is working to improve and promote usage of Math in Luganda, and perhaps achieve a penultimate goal of creating full solutions written entirely in Luganda.

## Current parts
As of now, we currently have the following parts in progress:
- Directly translated word list
- Dictionary definitions of each translated word
- Basic numbers literature
- Basic arithmetic
